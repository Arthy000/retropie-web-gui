# CONFIG FILES
## retropie.json
Set here all related to RetroPie config.
Pay attention to `path` which should point to the absolute path to RetroPie
folder.

## systems.json
Most likely you don't need to touch this file.
If you have, though, take a look at `path` which should point at the folder
where the roms for this system are located.
